What's the user experience look like using Google Drive on a Mac? This is mostly personal notes, but I thought I'd share
my experience for anyone else who might find it helpful.

I'm not going to try doing that on the phone, that was a lot of steps taken to share a file between my desktop and
browser.

Overall, it looks like files need to be dragged to the Google Drive folder once created. From there, they can be opened,
modified, saved, and synced.
