        In my last Rust post I decided to use Handlebars for the view layer. Handlerbars is really simple and easy to
        get going, but I wanted something a little more powerful. Awhile ago, I came across a Rust library called <a
            href="https://github.com/bodil/typed-html" target="_blank">typed-html</a> created by
        <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bodil">Bodil Stokke</a>. It's a fantastic library. What's so great
        about it? Besides the JSX like syntax, it'll only produce valid html and everything compiles! The
        biggest advantage I see with this is being able to change my attributes on my models and having the compiler
        tell me that my views are still correct. I haven't had the chance to work with a view layer with so much
        safety and I'm very much looking forward to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, I want to make sure I can create components to reuse my html code. Without that, I'd have to look for
        another view layer. After a little messing around I was able to get some code working. My simple example is to
        create a function where given two string arguments will render a button. The two string arguments represent
        the class name and the text of the button. Then I created two other functions to create a primary button and
        secondary button. Those two functions only argument is the button text. The functions call the button
        function and provide a class name specific to the caller function. This allows the class name to be encapsulated
        within the primary and secondary button functions. It's a pretty simple example, but can be
        extrapolated to more complex components solutions. The code is posted below and a link to the source code is at
        the bottom of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall, I thought it worked pretty well. I'm using Intellij and would really like code completion inside the
        <code>html!</code> macro. Code completion isn't a necessity, but it'd be really nice to have while I'm still
        learning Rust. Also, highlight.js, which I use for my code snippets, really doesn't like HTML inside a macro,
        sorry.

    <pre>
        <code class="rust">
use typed_html::dom::DOMTree;
use typed_html::html;
use typed_html::text;
use typed_html::elements::FlowContent;


fn button(class: &str, button_text: &str) -> Box&lt;dyn FlowContent&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    html!( &lt;button class={class} type="button"&gt; {text!(button_text)} &lt;/button&gt;)
}

fn primary_button(button_text: &str) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn FlowContent&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    button("Primary", button_text)
}

fn secondary_button(button_text: &str) -&gt; Box&lt;dyn FlowContent&lt;String&gt;&gt; {
    button("Secondary", button_text)
}


fn layout() -> String {
    let doc: DOMTree&lt;String&gt; = html!(
    &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;"typed-html-components"&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
            {primary_button("Click Primary!")}
            {secondary_button("Click Secondary!")}
        &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
);
    return doc.to_string();
}

fn main() {
    println!("{}", layout());
}
