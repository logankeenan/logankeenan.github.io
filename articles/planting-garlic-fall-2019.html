        Planting Garlic Fall 2019

        This year my wife and I planted close to 100 cloves of garlic. Around 75% of it came from Grade A Gardens, a
        local organic farm, and the remaining 25% came from organic garlic we bought from Trade Joes. We've planted
        garlic in the past, but only in our raised beds. This is the most we've planted by a significant margin. Given
        that we've planted so many, we'll need to learn how to cure the garlic when it's harvest in the summer so it'll
        have a longer shelf life. I'm going to go over the process we used this year as an example for others and for
        own own documentation.

        <strong>TLDR</strong>: Garlic should be planted in the Fall before the first freeze. Ideally, it should be
        spaced 6 inches apart from each other in either direction, so rows 6 inches apart and each clove 6 inches from
        another in a row. Creating rows that are 2 inches deep and 6 inches apart is difficult, so i ended up making 12"
        inch rows which is fine, but less space efficient. The bulb should be carefully broken apart with as much skin
        remaining on the clove as possible because it acts as a protective barrier. The clove should be positioned with
        the pointy end towards the sky.
