    <h1>Rendering Handlebar Templates with Rust and WASM (Web Assembly)</h1>

    <p>
        The rust implementation of <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust">Handlebars</a>
        was easy to get started Handlebars on the server, so I wanted
        to see what it would take to render my templates in the browser. I'm going to demonstration two features for
        handlebars. However, it's not limited to these; I just haven't had a need for other features. Lets take a look
        at using partials and helpers.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Handlebar Partials
    </h2>
    <p>
        We'll leverage partials to create a page layout and nest a page within it.
        The API for handlebars was pretty much the same as the the server. However, the templates cannot be read from
        the file system. Thankfully, Rust has the <a target="_blank"
                                                     href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.include_str.html">include_str!</a>
        macro which allows the templates to be read at compile time and included in the binary.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="handlebars">&lt;section&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Plantings 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
    {{&gt; page_content}}
&lt;/section&gt;
</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="handlebars">{{#&gt; layout_page}}
    {{#*inline &quot;page_content&quot;}}
        &lt;ul&gt;
            {{#each plants}}
                &lt;li&gt;
                    {{this}}
                &lt;/li&gt;
            {{/each}}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
    {{/inline}}
{{/layout_page}}
</code></pre>
    <pre><code class="rust">let layout = include_str!("./templates/layout.hbs");
let plantings_2020 = include_str!("templates/plantings_list.hbs");

let mut handlebars = Handlebars::new();
handlebars.register_template_string("layout_page", layout).unwrap();
let result = handlebars.render_template(
    plantings_2020,
    &json!({"plants":["green beans","tomatoes","peas","zucchini","peppers","cucumbers","soy beans","corn","melons"]}),
);
</code></pre>
    <h2>Handlebar Helpers</h2>
    <p>Fortunately, custom helpers is the same as the server-side code.</p>
    <pre><code class="rust">handlebars_helper!(uppercase: | string_to_uppercase: str| {
    string_to_uppercase.to_uppercase()
});
handlebars.register_helper("uppercase", Box::new(uppercase));
</code></pre>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
        Check out the demo <a href="https://github.com/logankeenan/logankeenan.github.io/repos/wasm-handlebars">repository</a>
        to see the full code as well as a working demo. The demo simply calls the Rust code (compiled to Wasm) which
        returns some html markup and set that's to the document body.
    </p>
    <p>
        This solution doesn't seem all that developer friendly. They would have to remember to include any new template
        so it'll be contained in the binary. The <a target="_blank" href="https://crates.io/crates/include_dir">include_dir</a>
        create could easily allow for a template factory with the path including the filename as a parameter.
