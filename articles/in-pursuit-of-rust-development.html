        In Pursuit of Rust Development
    </h1>
    <p>
        I've had a lot of interest in Rust for awhile now. I read <a target="_blank"
                                                                     href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust
        Programming Language</a> a year or more ago, but haven't taken the time to pursue any actual coding. I simply
        need to start coding and see if the ideas I've had in my head can actually work. I've been drawn to Rust for a
        few
        reasons. It's fast, can compile to Web Assembly, and is safe with a nice type system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rust is <strong>really</strong> fast! I come from a web background and have only written production code in C#,
        Java/Kotlin, Javascript, and Ruby. I realise that some these languages are faster than others, but I was shocked
        at how
        much faster Rust is. The speed of Rust is attractive because as the sole developer of a
        software company I'll ideally have less servers to manager and performances will be less of a concern.
    </p>
    <p>
        I could ramble on forever about all the things I'd like to try with Rust and Web Assembly. Being
        able to compile to Web Assembly will allow me to do all the things I'm able to do with Javascript but offer a
        nice typed system and significant performance improvements. My broad goal is to reuse a lot of the code
        between the server and the client and simplify the experience between writing server code and client code.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my opinion, types are nice and not using types is nice too. However, I'm just excited to be able to write
        server-side and client-side code using a typed language and see how the experience is. I could try this paradigm
        out with Typescript, but I'm tired of the Javascript ecosystem/community and want a change. The safety of the
        Rust is also attractive as a single developer. It's just one less thing to think about.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll be writing a few blog posts about my experiences with Rust as it relates to web
        development.  We'll see where it goes.
