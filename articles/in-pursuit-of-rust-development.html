        I've had a lot of interest in Rust for awhile now. I read <a target="_blank"
                                                                     href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust
        Programming Language</a> a year or more ago, but haven't taken the time to pursue any actual coding. I simply
        need to start coding and see if the ideas I've had in my head can actually work. I've been drawn to Rust for a
        few
        reasons. It's fast, can compile to Web Assembly, and is safe with a nice type system.
    </p>
    <p>
        Rust is <strong>really</strong> fast! I come from a web background and have only written production code in C#,
        Java/Kotlin, Javascript, and Ruby. I realise that some of these languages are faster than others, but I was
        shocked
        at how
        much faster Rust is. The speed of Rust is attractive because as the sole developer of a
        software company, I'll ideally have less servers to manager and performance will be less of a concern.
    </p>
    <p>
        I could ramble on forever about all the things I'd like to try with Rust and Web Assembly. Being
        able to compile to Web Assembly will allow me to do all the things I'm able to do with Javascript but offer a
        nice typed system and significant performance improvements. My broad goal is to reuse a lot of the code
        between the server and the client and simplify the experience between writing server code and client code.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't have a polarizing opinion about types; there are costs to both typed and non-typed languages. However,
        I'm excited to be able to write server-side and client-side code using a typed language and see how the
        experience is. I could try this paradigm out with Typescript, but I'm tired of the Javascript
        ecosystem/community and want a change. The safety guarantees of Rust is also a nice perk. I'm not building
        software in which lives depend on. However, anxiety around the "correctness" of the software should be reduced
        with the safety and verboseness of Rust.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'll be writing a few blog posts about my experiences with Rust as it relates to web
        development. We'll see where it goes.
